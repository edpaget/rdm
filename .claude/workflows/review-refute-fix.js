//|
//| Scale the fleet to what the change actually touches. **Always-on** dimensions
//| run for every review; **triggered** dimensions run only when the change hits
//| their surface. This keeps a 10-line change cheap while a cross-cutting change
//| still gets full coverage. Each dimension is reviewed by its own **read-only**
//| agent — it reviews and reports, it never edits. When in doubt about a trigger,
//| include the dimension: a spurious agent that finds nothing is cheaper than a
//| missed defect. State which dimensions you ran, and why, in the report.

// Findings scoring below this confidence are dropped even if not refuted.
//|
//| **Confidence floor.** Drop any finding whose post-refutation confidence is
//| below **70**, even when no refuter knocked it down.
const CONFIDENCE_FLOOR = 70;

// Ranking key: lower sorts first. Anything unknown sorts last.
//|
//| **Severity scale** (drives the verdict):
//|
//| - `blocking` — the work must not advance as-is: a logic error, an unmet
//|   acceptance criterion, or a mandatory process violation (e.g. a missing
//|   required changelog entry).
//| - `concern` — recorded but non-gating; it never by itself holds the work back.
//| - `suggestion` — minor optional improvement (subject to the confidence floor).
//|
//| Rank survivors most-severe first, then by confidence descending, then by id.
const SEVERITY_RANK = { blocking: 0, concern: 1, suggestion: 2 };

// The two dimension sets, selected by `mode`. Each finder agent reviews exactly
// one dimension; a fresh refuter then grades each finding it produced.
//   code — reviews an implementation diff (dispatch-phase's code-review stage).
//   plan — reviews a plan document (dispatch-phase's plan-review stage).
//
// A dimension with no `when` predicate is ALWAYS-ON. A dimension carrying
// `when(signals)` is TRIGGERED: `selectDimensions` evaluates it against both the
// change's shape AND the target's type. See selectDimensions' three-way contract
// below — omitted signals mean "unknown", and run everything.

//| 1. **escalated** — a surviving blocker that needs a *human decision* rather

//|    violates a stated architectural constraint, or the acceptance criteria
//|    themselves are missing, contradictory, or unimplementable as written.
//| 2. **rework** — else if any surviving finding is `blocking`, or the AC table
//|    contains any FAIL or PARTIAL criterion. The defect is fixable in place; the
//|    work goes back for another round.
//| 3. **reviewed** — else. Clean, or clean after small fixes. Surviving
//|    `concern` and `suggestion` findings are recorded and do **not** gate.
//|
//| Never downgrade a surviving `blocking` finding to "reviewed with concerns" —
//| a blocker always yields `rework` or `escalated`.
// The canonical outcome vocabulary. Every surface — the standalone review
// workflow, dispatch-phase, autopilot, and the interactive rdm-review skill —
// speaks exactly these three words. This retired the skill's older
